# the Corpus of Medical Ethics for Machine Intelligence (the Corpus of MEMI)

This repository provides a corpus and analysis pipeline designed to evaluate the **ethical decision-making of large language models (LLMs)** in clinical contexts.  
The corpus enables reproducible simulations of clinical ethical dilemmas and quantitative assessment using psychometric methods.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Evaluate the **ethicality** of both **LLMs and human respondents** in simulated clinical scenarios  
- Execute experiments with **human responses, GPT models (via API), and LLaMA-based models**  
- Estimate **latent ethicality scores** using **Item Response Theory (IRT)**‚Äìbased scoring  
- Analyze **reliability, validity of Corpus** through integrated R scripts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation


üí° Note:  
All steps up to the **Scoring** stage can be easily demonstrated on [üîóGoogle Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SgInxctJICtfod3RY7lUwwvCNVWKM8mR?usp=sharing). 
The repository is fully compatible with Colab, and users can reproduce the entire pipeline ‚Äî from scenario execution to ethicality score aggregation ‚Äî without a local setup.


Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/mEbara/MEMI_corpus.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Scenario Execution
Navigate to the execution directory and make directory for outputs:
```
cd exe
mkdir outputs
```
The corpus dataset is provided in a compressed format.  
Please unzip it before executing any scripts:
```
unzip data.zip
```

List all available clinical scenarios:
```
python play.py --play_mode Listup
```

Run a specific scenario manually (e.g., Q1):
```
python play.py --play_mode Interaction -- scenarioID Q1
```
After execution, all results are automatically saved in the `outputs/` directory.


## üßÆ Scoring
After scenarios have been executed:
```
cd ../analysis
python aggregate.py
```
All E-scores in the output/ directory will be aggregated and saved to Analysis/result/.


## üìä Analysis (R)
The following R scripts reproduce the psychometric analyses described in the paper.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Reliability & Model Fit Assessment
```
source("corpus_assess.r")

print(omega_result)   # Internal consistency (Cronbach's Œ±, McDonald's œâ)
print(cfa_result)     # Unidimesionality (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR)
print(q3_result)      # local dependence summary
print(TIC)            # Test Information Curve (TIC)
print(coef_result)    # Discrimination (a) and Difficulty (b) parameters
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Œ∏ Estimation and Group Comparison
```
source("estimate_theta.r") # The KDE plot of Œ∏ distributions is automatically saved as PDF.

print(result)              # Mean and SD of Œ∏ for each group
```
